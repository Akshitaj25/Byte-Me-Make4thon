TRACK – LGBTQ open innovation 

A website to introduce job opportunities for LGBTQ people. That would include various spheres – education, health, sex-ed, fashion, arts, music and writing (blogs and articles). We aim to connect those seeking opportunities with the ones who can provide these. 
 
Landing page – It will include an E-magazine which won’t just be including pictures and text but will feature videos and animation telling the tales of upliftment of other members and how they benefitted from our website. 
 
Education-  

Those who want teach: They can enter their location and qualification and in return can get the list of open vacancies near them. 

Those who want to learn: They’ll get study material and educators from across the country who won’t judge them on the basis of their sexual orientation and preferences. 

Fashion- we will provide a platform to upcoming fashion houses to showcase their work. They would need to submit their designs and link to their website. 

Law- cases of lgbtq people are often either ignored or they are denied justice. This would be a platform to connect such people with competent judges by just entering their location. 

People can post their artworks, blogs, articles, music videos etc. Which will be curated by our curators and then later posted. 

This would be the community for lgbtq people by their supporters
